- ðŸ‘‹ Hello and my name is Peter Kenny
- ðŸ‘€ My original training was in physical-organic chemistry and these days I would call myself a drug discovery scientist.
- Although currently retired, I remain scientifically active and am particularly interested in infectious diseases, hydrogen bonding and lipophilicity.
- Here are a couple of links:
